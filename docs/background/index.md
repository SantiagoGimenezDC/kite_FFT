KITE is a general purpose open-source tight-binding software for accurate real-space simulations of electronic structure and quantum transport properties of large-scale molecular and condensed systems with up to tens of billions of atomic orbitals ($N\sim 10^{10}$). In a nutshell, KITE takes real-space lattice models (tight-binding hamiltonians) of arbitrary complexity as an input that can be promptly defined by the user through its versatile Pybinding interface. Then, its memory-efficient and heavily-parallelised C++ code employs extremely accurate Chebyshev spectral expansions[^1] in order to extract *static electronic properties* (DoS, LDoS and spectral functions), *perturbative response functions* (linear and nonlinear conductivities) or even *dynamical effects* arising from the time-evolution of electronic wave-packets entirely in real-space. Since it is based upon real-space hamiltonians, KITE’s scope is not limited to periodic single-particle hamiltonians but, instead, its true power in unveiled through the study of more realistic models which may include disordered potentials, dilute impurities, structural defects, ad-atoms, mechanical strain and even external magnetic fields. Some illustrative examples may be found in the KITE’s presentation paper[^2]. See the [Tutorial][tutorial] section for a quick-start guide to the main features of KITE v1.1.

KITE's latest release (version 1.1) contains the following functionalities:

* Average density of states (DOS) and local DOS;
* $\mathbf{k}$-space Spectral Functions and ARPES Response;
* Linear DC conductivity (using the Kubo-Greenwood formula);
* First and Second-Order Optical (AC) Conductivities;
* Spin-Relaxation by Time-Evolution of Gaussian Wave-packets.

These calculations can now be applied to arbitrary two- and three-dimensional tight-binding hamiltonians that have:

* Generic multi-orbital local (on-site) and bond disorder;
* User-defined local potential profile and structural disorder;
* Different boundary conditions (periodic, open and twisted);
* Applied perpendicular magnetic field (limited use in 3D);

# A Short Background Story

The seeds for KITE’s project were laid in 2014, when an exact spectral expansion of the broadened lattice Green's function was discovered by **Aires Ferreira** in collaboration with Eduardo R. Mucciolo (University of Central Florida)[^3] and, independently, by A. Braun and P. Schmitteckert (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)[^4]. **Aires Ferreira** then developed a large-RAM "single-shot" recursive algorithm (with the technical assistance of M. D. Costa, National University of Singapore) that enabled the efficient evaluation of zero-temperature DC conductivity of huge tight-binding systems (more than 10 billion orbitals) entirely in real-space. At that time, this method proved essential to numerically show that the DC conductivity of graphene indeed attains finite value in the presence of dilute vacancies[^3].

In the following years, the usefulness of the above method in generic disordered lattices[5] with small coordination number $[Z=O(1)]$ became ever more clear by the development of similar techniques to  evaluate generic response functions, most notably the linear conductivity tensor  at finite temperature/frequency (proposed by **L. Covaci** and **T. G. Rappoport** in collaboration with José H. García (ICN2)[^6] [^7]) and the non-linear optical response (proposed by **S. M. João** and **J. M. Viana Parente Lopes**[^8]). It was the conjunction of all these proposals that put forward the joint venture that led to the first release of KITE in 2018[^2].

From its beginnings, KITE was sought to handle real-space lattice models of arbitrary complexity and realistically large sizes. Thereby, its architecture allies a versatile and user-friendly $\texttt{python}$ interface, with a highly efficient and CPU-scalable $\texttt{C++}$ code (developed by **J. M. Viana Parente Lopes**) that handles the heavy spectral computations. The interface is based on Pybinding’s syntax[^9] that allows the user to input an arbitrary (2D or 3D) lattice model decorated with a myriad of non-periodic perturbations, such as on-site disorder, personalized structural defects, strain, etc... This model hamiltonian is then passed to the $\texttt{C++}$ high-performance code ($\texttt{KITEx}$) that implements a *matrix-free* Chebyshev iteration which combines a domain-decomposition of the lattice with a *"tile-by-tile"* matrix-vector multiplication strategy in order to minimize memory-transfer overheads and thus boost parallelization and calculational efficiency[^2]. Such an approach allows the spectral calculations to be carried out for unheard-of huge system sizes, particularly by using modern large-RAM multi-core computers. Finally, a convenient *post-processing tool* ($\texttt{KITE-tools}$), developed by **S. M. João**, was also included in the package thereby turning KITE into a ready-to-use tool for practical applications.
